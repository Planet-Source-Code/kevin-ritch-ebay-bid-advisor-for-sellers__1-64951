### Description

A COOL eBay Seller's tool...

eBay Selling is fun. But when eBay sellers want to be informed when people have made bids on their items, this is a neat Alert program.

Every 30 seconds the application checks eBay to see if somebody has made a bid. If so, it rings a cash register sound and pops an Alert onto the screen.

If you like it, please do vote. (I will remember you in my will :-)
 
### More Info
 
It BUILDS the Cash Register WAV file automatically when first used. I didn't invent the WAV file, it's the Windows one - but it builds it anyway.

Happiness

You need to be a registered eBay Seller for this to work.
